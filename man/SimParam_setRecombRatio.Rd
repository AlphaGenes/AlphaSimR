\description{
Defines a gender specific recombination ratio. 
The ratio is defined as the amount of recombination in 
females relative to male. Thus, a value of 1 (default) 
specifies equal recombination rates in both males and females. 
A value of 2 specifies twice as much recombination in females 
and a value of 0.5 specifies half as much recombination in 
females.
