\title{Set phenotypes}
\usage{
setPheno(pop, varE, reps = 1, w = 0, simParam = SIMPARAM)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or 
\code{\link{HybridPop-class}}}

\item{varE}{error variances for phenotype. A vector of length 
nTraits for independent error or a square matrix of dimensions 
nTraits for correlated errors.}

\item{reps}{number of replications for phenotype. See details.}

\item{w}{the environmental covariate used by GxE traits. If pop 
is \code{\link{HybridPop-class}} an error will be returned for any 
value other than 0.}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam-class}}}
}
\value{
Returns an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or 
\code{\link{HybridPop-class}}
}
\description{
Sets phenotypes for all traits by adding random error 
from a multivariate normal distribution.
}
\details{
The reps parameter is for convient representation of replicated data. 
It was intended for representation of replicated yield trials in plant 
breeding programs. In this case, varE is set to the plot error and 
reps is set to the number plots per entry. The resulting phenotype 
would reflect the mean of all replications.
