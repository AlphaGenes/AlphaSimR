\usage{
createSimulation(founderPop, maxQtl = 0, maxSnp = 0,
  snpQtlOverlap = FALSE, minSnpFreq = NULL, gender = "no",
  recombRatio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{founderPop}{an object of \code{\link{MapPop-class}}}

\item{maxQtl}{the maximum number of segSites for QTLs. 
Can be a single value or values for each chromosome.}

\item{maxSnp}{the maximum number of segSites for SNPs. 
Can be a single value or values for each chromosome.}

\item{snpQtlOverlap}{should SNPs and QTLs be allowed to overlap}

\item{minSnpFreq}{minimum allowable frequency for SNPs}

\item{gender}{should gender be considered in the simulation. 
Options are: no, yes_rand, or yes_sys. See details.}

\item{recombRatio}{ratio of genetic recombination in female 
gametes relative to male gametes. A value of 1 means equal 
recombination rates in both sexes.}

\value{
Returns an object of \code{\link{SimParam-class}}

\description{
Starts the process of building a new simulation
}
\details{
There are three options for gender. Option "no" means gender is not 
used. All individuals will have "H" for gender, which represents 
hermaphrodite. Option "yes_rand" means that all new individuals are 
randomly assigned either an "M" or "F" for gender, which represents 
male and female, respectively. Option "yes_sys" means gender assigned 
systematically when new individuals are created. Odd individuals recieve 
an "M" and even individuals recieve an "F". If gender is used, it will 
prevent crossing between same gender individuals using the \code{\link{randCross}} 
or \code{\link{randCross2}} functions.
