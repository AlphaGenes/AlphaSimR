\usage{
createSimulation(InitialHaplo, inbred = T, ploidy = 2, maxSnp, maxQtl,
  snpQtlOverlap = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{InitialHaplo}{an object of class InitialHaplo}

\item{inbred}{should founders be inbred}

\item{ploidy}{level of ploidy in species. Currently only 2 supported.}

\item{maxSnp}{the maximum number of segSites for SNPs. Can be a single value or values for each chromosome.}

\item{maxQtl}{the maximum number of segSites for QTLs. Can be a single value or values for each chromosome.}

\item{snpQtlOverlap}{should SNPs and QTLs be allowed to overlap}

\item{assignGender}{should individuals have gender}
