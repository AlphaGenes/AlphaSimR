\title{Set recombination tracking}
\arguments{
\item{isTrackRec}{should recombination tracking be on.}
}
\description{
Sets recombination tracking for the simulation. 
By default recombination tracking is turned off. When turned 
on recombination tracking will also turn on pedigree tracking. 
Recombination tracking keeps records of all individuals created, 
except those created by \code{\link{hybridCross}}, because their 
pedigree is not tracked.
