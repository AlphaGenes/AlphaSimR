\title{Set GCA as phenotype}
\usage{
setPhenoGCA(pop, testers, useGv = FALSE, varE = NULL, reps = 1, w = 0,
  inbred = FALSE, simParam = SIMPARAM)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{testers}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{useGv}{should genetic values be used instead of phenotypes}

\item{varE}{error variances for phenotype if useGv=FALSE. A vector 
of length nTraits for independent error or a square matrix of 
dimensions nTraits for correlated errors.}

\item{reps}{number of replications for phenotype. See details.}

\item{w}{the environmental covariate used by GxE traits.}

\item{inbred}{are both pop and testers fully inbred. They are only 
fully inbred if created by \code{\link{newPop}} using inbred founders 
or by the \code{\link{makeDH}} function}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam-class}}}
}
\value{
Returns an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}
}
\description{
Calculates general combining ability from a set of testers and 
returns these values as phenotypes for a population.
}
\details{
The reps parameter is for convient representation of replicated data. 
It was intended for representation of replicated yield trials in plant 
breeding programs. In this case, varE is set to the plot error and 
reps is set to the number plots per entry. The resulting phenotype 
would reflect the mean of all replications.
