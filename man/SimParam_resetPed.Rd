\title{Reset pedigree}
\description{
Resets both lastId and the pedigree. This will 
unlock SimParam functions that only run when lastId is 0. Be careful 
using \code{\link{Pop-class}} objects created before running this 
function, because they are tied to the older pedigree that is 
being deleted.
