\title{Write data records}
\usage{
writeRecords(pop, dir, snpChip, useQtl = FALSE, reps = 1,
  simParam = SIMPARAM)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{dir}{path to a directory for saving output}

\item{snpChip}{which SNP chip genotype to save. If useQtl=TRUE, this 
value will indicate which trait's QTL genotype to save.}

\item{useQtl}{should QTL genotype be written instead of SNP chip 
genotypes.}

\item{reps}{number of reps for phenotypes. This values is used for modelling 
heterogenous error variance in genomic selection models. Leave value as 1 
unless using reps for phenotypes.}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam-class}}}
}
\description{
Saves a population's phenotypic and marker data to a directory.
