\usage{
writeRecords(pop, dir, snpChip = 1, useQtl = FALSE, reps = 1,
  fixEff = 1, includeHaplo = FALSE, append = TRUE, simParam = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{dir}{path to a directory for saving output}

\item{snpChip}{which SNP chip genotype to save. If useQtl=TRUE, this
value will indicate which trait's QTL genotype to save. A value of
0 will skip writing a snpChip.}

\item{useQtl}{should QTL genotype be written instead of SNP chip
genotypes.}

\item{reps}{number of reps for phenotypes. This values is used for modelling
heterogenous error variance in genomic selection models. Leave value as 1
unless using reps for phenotypes.}

\item{fixEff}{an integer indicating levels of fixed effect. Leave
value as 1 if not using different levels of fixed effects.}

\item{includeHaplo}{should markers be seperated by female and male
haplotypes.}

\item{append}{if true, new records are added to any existing records.
If false, any existing records are deleted before writing new records.
Note that this will delete all files in the 'dir' directory.}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam}}}
}

Saves a population's phenotypic and marker data to a directory.
