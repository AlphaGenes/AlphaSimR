\arguments{
\item{gender}{acceptable value are "no", "yes_sys", or 
"yes_rand"}
}
\description{
Changes how gender is used in the simulation. 
The default gender of a simulation is "no". To add gender 
to the simulation, run this function with "yes_sys" or 
"yes_rand". The value "yes_sys" will systematically assign 
gender to newly created individuals as first male, then female. 
Thus, odd numbers of individuals will have one more male than 
female. The value "yes_rand" will randomly assign gender to 
individuals.
