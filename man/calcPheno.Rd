\title{Calculate phenotypes}
\usage{
calcPheno(pop, varE, reps = 1, w = 0.5, simParam = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or 
\code{\link{HybridPop-class}}}

\item{varE}{error variances for phenotype. A vector of length 
nTraits for independent error or a square matrix of dimensions 
nTraits for correlated errors.}

\item{reps}{number of replications for phenotype. See details.}

\item{w}{the environmental covariate used by GxE traits.}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam}}}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of nInd by nTrait phenotypes
}
\description{
Calculates phenotypes for all traits by adding random error 
from a multivariate normal distribution. This function is called 
by \code{\link{setPheno}}.
}
\details{
The reps parameter is for convient representation of replicated data. 
It is intended to represent replicated yield trials in plant 
breeding programs. In this case, varE is set to the plot error and 
reps is set to the number of plots per entry. The resulting phenotype 
represents entry means.
