\title{Pull Identity By Descent (IBD) haplotypes}
\usage{
pullIbdHaplo(pop = NULL, chr = NULL, snpChip = NULL, pedigree = NULL,
  simParam = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or 
\code{\link{RawPop-class}}. If NULL, haplotypes for the whole
ancestral pedigree are retreived. Otherwise, haplotypes just for
the \code{pop} individuals are retreived. In both cases the base
population is controlled by \code{SimParam} and \code{pedigree}.}

\item{chr}{a vector of chromosomes to retrieve. If NULL, 
all chromosome are retrieved.}

\item{snpChip}{an integer. Indicates which SNP chip's loci
are retrieved. If NULL, all segregatibg sites are retrieved.}

\item{pedigree}{a matrix with ancestral pedigree. It should have
two columns - the first one with mother id and the second one
with father id - as in simParam$pedigree, see
\code{\link{SimParam_setTrackRec}}. If NULL, whole pedigree
from \code{\link{SimParam}} is taken.}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam}}}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of haplotypes with Identity By Descent
(IBD) coding of locus alleles. The matrix colnames reflect whether
all segregagting loci (sites) are retreived or only SNP array loci.
