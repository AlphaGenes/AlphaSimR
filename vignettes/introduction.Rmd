The AlphaSimR package provides a framework for simulating plant and animal breeding programs in R. It is based on the [AlphaSim](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/articles/0/0/plantgenome2016.02.0013) program. This document will introduce the basic steps for running a simulation with the AlphaSimR package.

### Creating founder haplotypes

The first step to a simulation in AlphaSimR is to create a set of founder haplotypes. This is done using the `runMacs` function which uses the [MaCS](https://github.com/gchen98/macs) program. The MaCS program is not part of the AlphaSimR package and must be downloaded and compiled by the users. Pre-compiled versions of MaCS can be obtained by downloading the AlphaSim program which is available on the [AlphaGenes](http://www.alphagenes.roslin.ed.ac.uk/alphasuite-softwares/alphasim/) website.
